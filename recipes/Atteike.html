<h4> Attiéké is the famous cassava semolina nicknamed “couscous of Ivory Coast”. It is a cassava-based dish that is an integral part of Ivorian cuisine in Africa. Attiéké is made from fermented cassava that has been grated or granulated. </h4>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> 1 bag of attiéke about 1 lb.</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon vinegar</li>
    <li> 2 Maggi or stock cubes </li>
    <li> 2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place the attiéké in a metal bowl then place in a steamer basket and steam until all the water has been absorbed.</li>
    <li>Now remove from the steamer and work the attiéké with a fork to break up any clumps.</li>
    <li>Return to the steamer and cook for about 10 minutes more. </li>
    <li> Turn the attiéké into a bowl and work with a fork to break up all the clumps (if the clumps do not break up, then it has not cooked enough.</li>
    <li>Steam for a further 10 minutes. </li>
    <li> Continue with this process until the attiéké is fluffy and cooked but not sloppy (it should look like couscous or grits). </li>
    <li> Once it is done, turn into a large bowl and work in the vinegar, crumbled Maggi cubes and olive oil. To serve, turn the attiéké onto a dish and garnish with a little diced tomato and thin slivers of sliced onion</li>
